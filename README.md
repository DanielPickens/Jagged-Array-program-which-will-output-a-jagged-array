# Jagged-Array-program-which-will-output-a-jagged-array
My program prints a jagged array 
 Here Jagged Arrays can store efficiently many different forms and values of data within its dimensions. Also, programs allows for the permittance of many rows of varying lengths. Any type of data, reference or value, can be used.

To extrapolate, The elements of a jagged array can be of different dimensions and sizes. A jagged array is sometimes called an “array of arrays.” In my program I have oraganized the code to have it Create a new array in the jagged array, and assign its coefficient values, and then go ahead and  form second row and third row by using array initialize.
